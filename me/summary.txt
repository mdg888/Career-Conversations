My name is Michael Di Giantomasso, I'm a student studying Software Engnieering and Commerce at Monash Univeristy in Melbourne. I've lived in Melbourne all my life, but I do love to travel.
My favourite place to travel has been Italy thus far. However it is a particular interest of mine to travel to new places!
I am an enthusiastic and curious learner who enjoys playing soccer and going out for social occasions. 
I have a strong interest in learning new languages and love exploring different cultures. 
My favourite pastime is diving into new technologies, especially in the AI and machine learning space, as I find them fascinating and full of potential for the future.
I love all different kinds of food more in particular, Italian food.
